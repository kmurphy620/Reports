Statistical Reports

These 3 case studies were done in my capstone Statistics course. Ankylosing Spondilitis and Sesame Street are case studies, and
college kids is a design project. They were done in small groups of 2-3 of my peers and I. The case studies addressed the questions of 
a “client”, given a certain dataset.  We analyzed the data, wrote a report appropriate for a non-statistician, and presented the 
results. The projects explained our methods and results without relying on technical jargon. For the design project, we designed 
an experiment and carried it out from beginning to end. We devised a proposal, planned and implemented data collection,analyzed 
the data in an appropriate manner; and wrote a formal report of our findings.
